## About VoidShaper and it's Mythos
VoidShaper is lovingly based within the works of Peter F Hamilton and his Void trilogy. This mythos takes place within the void, on the world of Querencia.
The Void is an artificial pocket universe with different laws of physics than our own. Within it, those with the ability can modify the laws of the universe, including moving time forward and backward, phasing through matter etc. This was an intended feature of the unviverse, giving the original creaters the ability to have a Utopia. 
The current denizens are human colonists who "crashed" accidentally through the outer wall of the void and on to Querencia. With them they brought genetically engineered animals that were meant to be modified in the embryonic stage. Unfortunatley, electronics inherently do not work within the Void. Fortunately, due to the nature of the void, those adept enough can modify them by hand by "Shaping". This is an extremely difficult task that is supposed to take decades to learn how to do simply. This is the story of someone highly adept.
* World name: Querencia
* Native animals have 5 limbs
    * generally two front legs, two hind legs and a strong central rear leg which can be used for propulsion.
* Genistars
    * Not native 
    * Capacity to have 12 limbs (6 arms, 6 legs)
    * Growth can be halted (IE 6 legs, but only ephemeral stubby arms)
    * Are shaped based on creatures from earth still in the common memory of the humans, or in their records from "long ago"

## Game Progress
1. Start with 1 Default genistar
2. Default lays eggs
3. Process Eggs
    * Shape eggs into creatures
    * Sell eggs at the market
    * Stock pile eggs for???
4. Sell creatures at market
    * Demand / value based on creature ability
        * (A work ge-horse will be more valuable than a ge-rat)
5. Use currency to expand stable and guild
    * Stable
        * Increased slots to host Defaults and other creatures
            * Can only host 1 of each creature at first
        * Higher egg cap (storage)
    * Guild
        * Hire apprentices to shape for you
            * Apprentices are not all equal
            * Basic stats around "capability", or inherent talent to feel the void
        * Increased noteriety (higher prices / market cap)
6. Level character to better void shaping abilities
    * EXP increases on successful shaping, sales, etc
    * Increased levels buff shaping skill
    * Increased shaping skill increases creature stats/value
    * Increase "knowledge of void" to learn how to manipulate the void, leads to prestige
7. Prestige
    * Prestige mechanic is using "knowledge of void" to reset history back to the beginning, but you retain everything you knew of past events, giving you a bonus to various production


## Creatures (Genistars) of the Void
'Shaped' creatures are prefixed by "ge". In this universe there are some real animals, but ge-animals are usually superior and thus used for labor/tasks.

##### In no particular order:
* Default
    * The creature that spawns eggs
    * Born from an un-shaped egg
    * 
* ge-mouse
* ge-squirrel
* ge-snake
* ge-horse
* ge-dog
* ge-cat
* ge-pidgeon
* ge-monkey
